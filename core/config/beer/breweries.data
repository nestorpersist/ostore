It is located in the city of Drammen, approximately 25 miles south of our capital, Oslo. You will spot it at the banks of the Drammen River at the very same place as it has been since 1834. The annual production of beer is aprox. 10 mill liter (85 000 barrels), and together with the production of 18 mill liters of soft drinks and mineralwater it gives employment to approximately 150 people.  You may wonder how we got our name ? It was a young fellow with the name Poul Lauritz Aass that bought the brewery in 1860. Since then it has been in the same family, and is today run by the 4th generation of Aass. (By the way - A real Norwegian viking would pronounce it Ouse)  The brewery is proud of its history. To us the quality of what we produce has always been and always will be the main issue. In 1516, Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria established a law admitting only malted barley, hops yeast, and water as ingredients in the production of beer. The law is known as the purity law and Aass Brewery is still loyal to Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria. In Norway the brewery is known for outstanding quality and large number of different beer types.","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}

The Allagash story, however, has roots that go much further back then the ten years the Portland, Maine brewery has been in operation. The roots go into the early 1990's when founder Rob Tod saw something missing in the American beer market. They are interwoven in the craft brewing movement that has allowed the creativity of brewers to flourish over the last twenty years, and those same roots have ties that go back centuries-to the monasteries of Belgium, whose own ancient brewing methods are now practiced today by the brewers of Allagash. Allagash began as a one-man operation, with Tod assuming all brewing duties in a small space located in a building on the outskirts of the maritime city of Portland. Tod had worked in brewery settings before and recognized a void within the craft brewing movement. While both German and British styles had become prevalent throughout the U.S., the ever-creative Belgian-styles were very difficult to find. Through his travels, Tod had sampled many of these unique beers and felt that the flavors and traditions of this European nation needed to be shared with the American drinking public. He designed a small 15-barrel brewhouse specifically to embrace the Belgian tradition of beer making, gathered the finest array of authentic raw materials and began his quest towards the production of traditional Belgian style ales. Allagash began with the release of its Allagash White, modeled after the traditional White beers of Belgium. Also referred to as wit beers, they get their unique flavor from the use of wheat in place of barley, Curacao orange peel and the careful sprinkling of coriander and other spices. Allagash combined these ingredients with their very own proprietary Belgian yeast strain to create the remarkably unique and refreshing beer that is today their flagship brand. Allagash White developed a strong cult following around the Portland area where it was available at selected draft accounts. Due to its immediate success, the beer was soon made available in 12-ounce six-packs throughout the state of Maine. With the success of the first brand, Rob realized two things: The public was asking for some new styles and the workload was getting to be too much for one person. Soon after, two experienced brewers were hired and Allagash released their second brew, Allagash Double Ale. Using the philosophy and techniques created by the Trappist Monks of Belgium centuries ago, the staff created this beer using seven different malts, a traditional sugar, and their own Belgian yeast strain. The result was another unique yet balanced beer crafted in the classic Belgian style. To truly appreciate the classic styles and brewing traditions of Belgium, one must experience beer created in the classic Belgian package. This is why Allagash, after an extensive period of research, released their distinctive Reserve line of cork finished 750 ML bottles. This unique line employs the ancient tradition referred to as the mÃ©thode champenoise. The technique calls for two fermentations, one in the Brewery's fermenting tanks and the second in the bottle itself. It is this second fermentation that produces a notable increase in carbonation, a softer mouthfeel, and beers of remarkable complexity. This method of bottle conditioning leaves a small amount of yeast in the bottle, creating what is known as a living beer. As a result, these styles have a greatly enhanced shelf life and some styles will age exceptionally, much like a fine wine. Just as the styles originate in Belgium, so does the package itself. To insure authenticity, Allagash imports the bottles and corks directly from the same country that designed the techniques. This enables the beers to reach carbonation levels similar to champagne while allowing the corks to pop characteristically upon serving. Today, Allagash still remains one of very few breweries in North America using this distinctive package. From the very beginning, Allagash has strived to produce the finest Belgian-style and experimental ales this side of the Atlantic. It began as New England's original Belgian-Style brewery and has grown into one of the industry's most distinguished and well-respected brands. Following the time-tested brewing traditions of ancient Belgium, Allagash now produces a broad-ranging portfolio of artisanal beers with uncompromising quality.","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}

From start to finish, he is a one-man operation. The former cabinetmaker is also a self-reliant Mainer through and through. He was originally an all-grain homebrewer who decided to take it to the next level when his friends expressed interest in his beers. He designed the 12-barrel brewing system himself and enlisted a local welder to help put it together. Hazen notes that when you live in Maine, you have to find some service to provide to others in order to survive. For him, brewing is the service he provides to his local community. Located in the rolling hills of Lincolnville, Maine, Andrew's is housed in a renovated farmhouse next to Hazen's home. Finding the brewery is more than half the battle. Have no fear, however, as everyone knows about Andrew's. Also, be aware that due to some thieving souls, the brewery no longer has any signage to announce its existence to the visiting public. The only indication that a brewery exists in the farmhouse are the occasional keg deliveries in Hazen's front yard. And Hazen hasn't been quick to replace the sign either. While he welcomes visitors, you have to remember to clear a path for the busy brewer. Like many other unsung small brewers, running his 5OO-barrel per year brewery is a seven day a week operation for Hazen. Watching Hazen run the brewery is a little like watching Willy Wonka run the Chocolate Factory. When I visit him during a bottling day, Hazen runs between the bottling line and the packaging supplies in a hurried yet methodical manner. He stands up bottles on the line, starts the machine, slides his way across the brewhouse to the packaging materials, and hand assembles the six-packs that will hold the soon-to-be bottled beer. Andrew's beer is straightforward, unassuming and entirely enjoyable. His product line includes the St. Nick Porter, the Northern Brown Ale, the English Pale Ale, and the summer seasonal Ruby's Golden Ale. A celebration of the Amarillo hop, Hazen's English Pale Ale is a delightfully balanced product that neither over or underwhelms the palate.  from beerscribe.com","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}

Thank you for embracing our fiercely independent vision of a hand-crafted future for all! Operating as a brewpub from August 1995 until February 2005, The BarrelHouse Brewing Company recently relocated to our current location in the West End of downtown Cincinnati. We officially reopened with a completed expansion plan in April 2005. Our expansion included almost doubling our fermentation capacity as well as the addition of a brand new bottling line. Our first order of bottled beer hit Ohio area stores in June 2006 and we have subsequently begun to enter markets that were previously unavailable. The BarrelHouse Brewing Company brews on a 15 BBL brewhouse manufactured by Century. One BBL equals 31 gallons therefore; our beers are hand-crafted in 465 gallon batches. Our ales are ready after approximately fourteen days while our lagers are conditioned for upwards of six weeks. By brewing in small batches, our brewers are able to achieve an optimal level of quality control while creating a consistently flavorful product.

After nearly a year of distributing beer, an opportunity arose for Mike to work as a brewer for Legend Brewing Company. Mike worked with five other brewers to perform duties at all levels of production including brewing, cellar work, cleaning and maintenance.  After nearly four years of service at Legend Brewing Company, Mike moved to Boston, MA, so his wife, Kira, could attend grad school. Tired of listening to him whine about how much he missed brewing, Kira gave him a home brewing kit as an anniversary gift. Mike began brewing whenever he could find the time. He developed the recipes for Hammerin' Ale, Headbangerz Brown Ale, Square Feet Wheat, Weldspatter I.P.A. and several other beers in five-gallon batches on his apartment's balcony.  Mike was also commissioned by friends and co-workers to brew beer for special occasions.  In fact, Square Feet Wheat was actually first brewed for an art gallery opening featuring works by the Barbarian's logo and label designer, Erick Thomas.  After reading Brewing Up a Business: Adventures in Entrepreneurship by Sam Calagione of Dogfish Head Brewery fame, Mike was inspired to start his own brewery. He spent eight months researching and writing a business plan. Another year was spent gathering support and revising his business plans. Thanks to the support of family, friends and other area businessmen who believed in Mike's dream, Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company is now a reality."}

Within seven months of opening El Toro Brewing Company received its first national recognition at the 1994 Great American Beer Festival (GABF). One of its flagships El Toro Oro Golden Ale won a coveted Gold Medal for English Pale Ale. At the 1996 GABF Poppy Jasper Amber Ale, the brewery's other flagship beer, won a Silver Medal for English Brown Ale. It is a mild yet robust brown ale. The 1997 GABF saw El Toro garner another Gold Medal for the American styled wheat beer named after the brewer's father-in-law, William Jones Wheat Beer.  After 16 years of planning, Geno and Cindy Acevedo of Morgan Hill finally opened a brewpub on November 25 2006. El Toro Brewpub is a two floored building with patio. Inside is the world's only Poppy Jasper Bar. Featuring over 45 feet of gorgeously inlaid and polished Poppy Jasper rock into its surface. To the back of the large mirrored bar you will find over 25 beers and handcrafted sodas on tap. We also have a gleaming copper Pub Brewing system 3 BBL (100 gallon) brewery.

For the first summer we offered four beers:  Estes Park Porter, Estes Park Renegade, Longs Peak Raspberry Wheat and Estes Park Pale Ale.  In the fall of 1994, Gordon Knight decided to sell his half of the business. When Gordon left, Eric Bratrud took over as the head Brewer. The Brewery also expanded to a 14 BBL Brewhouse and moved out onto the main floor where is now located. In 1995 we started packaging our beers in 12 oz bottles, which expanded our market. By this time we had added a number of beers including Trail Ridge Red, Estes Park Gold, Stinger Wild Honey Wheat and Samson Stout. 1995 was also the first year of the Best of the West Brewfest held in the Brewery parking lot. Since '95 we've continued to evolve both in our restaurant and with our brewing operations. In 2003 Tyler Lemirande and Eric Bratrud took over as owners.","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}

In search of a calmer life and an even better beer, Jeff turned his passion for brewing into a career. After a temporary stint at Northern Brewer and a job as an assistant brewer at Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery, Flat Earth opened in Saint Paul and set out to create beers not normally found in the upper Midwest. Flat Earth's distinctive brews are often inspired by the couple's travels and time spent in conversation with family and friends. The company's brewing on the edge philosophy is reflected in its stylish interpretation of traditional brewing assumptions. Today, Flat Earth Brewing produces a variety of artisan ales and lagers every month. As the beers roll out of the brewery, you're sure to see a theme develop around their names  a hint of conspiracy, perhaps. The names are meant to get people thinking and talking. Whether you enjoy Flat Earth beers at home or out with friends, there are no secrets when it comes to good beer.","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}

That early Web site helped generate positive press coverage and helped attract the investors needed to make the virtual brewery a real one. Muller said the idea was to make the Web site This Old House meets the World Wide Webï¿½letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.  He also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12","last_mod":"000 subscribers. Muller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order). Flying Fish Brewing Company is located in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia. In a state that once boasted 50 breweries, it is the first microbrewery in Southern New Jersey and the first new brewery built in that part of the state in more than half a century. From its opening in late 1996, Flying Fish has tripled its capacity and become the largest of the approximately 20 craft breweries in the state. Head brewer Casey Hughes now produces four full-time styles, as well as a variety of seasonal beers.   The key word to describe all Flying Fish beers is balance. The beers are full-flavored, yet highly drinkable. Flavors harmonize, not fight for individual attention. Hopping is generous, but to style. Seeing beer as equal to, if not superior to, wine, Flying Fish beers are designed to complement food. Because of this effort, one can walk into any fine restaurant in the Philadelphia region and be pretty sure of finding a Flying Fish beer available. Flying Fish beers were the first in the region to be featured at the Great British Beer Festival, Oregon Brewers Festival and Canada's Biere de Mondial Festival. They have also won several medals at the Real Ale Festival in Chicago, the World Beer Championships and is the only New Jersey brewery featured in the 2000 book Best American Beers."}

After our travels, we asked each other, why not bring great beer and that sense of community to New England?  That was the genesis of the Harpoon Brewery.  Twenty years later we still revel in making great beer and sharing that joy with our friends and neighbors.  The success that we have had running Harpoon is due entirely to the wonderful employees who brew, package, warehouse, sell, deliver, and market our beer and you, the people who drink Harpoon.

Its rich history includes partnerships with local taverns, preservation of local historical pieces, unique tours, family style dining options and most importantly, great beer. President Russ Klisch said it all started with his brother, Jim.  Jim expressed interest in beer making near his birthday and Russ humored him by purchasing him a book on the subject.  Jim read the book and brewed the beer.  Although not known, according to Russ, as a gourmet cook, Jim made a good beer.  Russ was impressed and decided he could do it better.  In short, sibling competitiveness and common interest lead both to entering contests in beer making.  They both received awards, and family and friends encouraged them to start the business. Their family had roots in the beer industry as well.  Their grandfather worked for Schlitz driving a street sweeper and a truck.  Russ Klisch remembers him bringing home short fills to his dad.  He recalls, even as a kid, that it was a cool job if you got to bring beer home at night.  Taverns were also owned by several family members. With that family history and their common interest in beer making, the brothers started their business.  They decided to start small.  Initially, they bought an old pizza bakery building down the street from their home in Riverwest.  They liked the location and the fact that they could walk there from home.  They sold their first barrel on December 2, 1987.  They stayed at that location until winter of 1998.","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}

At Philadelphia Brewing Co we take pride in our brews, our people, and our community. One person could never do everything that it takes to get beer into your glass. And it may sound obvious, but we won't brew anything that we wouldn't drink ourselves - you won't catch us drinking anything called Ultra unless it's a literal name meaning more flavor, more hops, more malt, more carbs. That's because we are Brewers; proud brewers of fine hand crafted Ales from our historic brewery building in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. Now that's out of the way; we will be starting out with four mainstay brews which will be available in draught and in bottles. Once we're stocked up on the core brews we'll start pumping out regular seasonal or specialty brews. The specialty series will be driven by our individual brewers and the desires and whims of the rest of our family.  The beer is flowing at Philadelphia Brewing co! You can find our four brands on tap at finer establishments all around town!","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}

Peter Egelston, Head Brewer in Northampton from 1987 until 1991, moved to Portsmouth to set up the new brewery here. (Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) The brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list. Head Brewer Tod Mott arrived in late 2003, bringing with him is award-winning ways and oursized personality. All of the beers served at the Portsmouth Brewery are brewed right here on premise, with the exception of those beers, such as Shoals Pale Ale and Portsmouth Lager, brewed at Smuttynose Brewing Company, our sister company. --http://www.portsmouthbrewery.com/htmlpages.portsmouth/beerlist.html","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}

In no time the 6 original aging tanks were maxed out so we added on to the building and installed 13 new tanks. By 2001 Red Oaks popularity had grown so much that we were brewing 24/7...and out of aging capacity.

After settling on a 12 acre tract along I 40/85 between Greensboro and Burlington in 2003...we began discussions with 3 Bavarian Brewery fabricators. Rolec of Cheming, Bavaria was chosen to supply the new brewery; and in 2005 construction began on the building to house it.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.

It is known as the aforementioned Pils Legend, because it was a bitter specialty during the communist period in Germany.

Even though at the end of the 19th century the label now had five independent breweries, the families were still competing with each other. By 1910 the company had established itself throughout Germany and the Netherlands, and was even served on the renowned Hapag-Lloyd ships that ran from Hamburg to America.[1] The company was acquired by the Bitburger Braugruppe GmbH in 2002.

And, no one else has a Brewmaster ready to welcome visitors in period costume.\n\nIn the 1860s there were 155 registered breweries in Ontario, and countless smaller operations. Black Creek Historic Brewery is the first in this province to replicate the brewing processes of that era, when there was no electricity or refrigeration, no stainless steel tanks or bottling plants.\n\nThe equipment at Black Creek Historic Brewery is made mainly of wood and copper, and the beer ferments the way it was done in the old days, with wooden barrels to age the beer. Malted barley is shoveled by hand into the wort tun where it is boiled into a mash. After filtering the solids through a linen cloth, the sugary liquid is boiled and hops are added, both for flavouring and as a natural preservative. Once the boiling is complete, the beer is put in barrels where the yeast is added. A short time later, the beer is ready!\n\nVisitors can sample the beer at cellar temperature, the way it was enjoyed in the past, or drink a chilled pint in the pub, the way many people prefer it today.
